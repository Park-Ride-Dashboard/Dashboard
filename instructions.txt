Prerequisite for the following installation is that you have python 3 and pip(prefferably version 20+) 
installed. If not follow these linked instructions and then procede:

Install Python: 
Windows 10: https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/install-python-windows-10
Mac: https://www.dataquest.io/blog/installing-python-on-mac/
Linux: https://docs.python-guide.org/starting/install3/linux/

Pip may be already installed depending on how you installed python.
See if you have pip installed by opening your command line/terminal and entering "pip" and view the pip 
version by entering "pip --version".

Install Pip:
Windows 10: https://www.dataquest.io/blog/install-pip-windows/
Mac: https://phoenixnap.com/kb/install-pip-mac
Linux: https://www.odoo.com/de_DE/forum/hilfe-1/how-to-install-pip-in-python-3-on-ubuntu-18-04-167715

If you are reading this file you probably have access to the github reository where the dashboard 
application is located. Clone this repository.
If you dont know how: https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository

Next navigate your terminal to the folder where you cloned the repository. Make sure that our file 
"requirements.txt" is in the same folder as you currently are. To do that you can either enter "dir"(Windows)
or "ls"(Mac/Linux) and see if the file is listed there. Enter "pip install -r requirements.txt" to install 
the necessary dependencies for the project. If the "requirements.txt" file is not there, download it 
from our repository and run "pip install -r path_to_file" where path_to_file is the path to the place you
put the requirements.txt file including the filename and -ending.

After successfully installing all dependencies, you can now navigate to the App directory and run the file 
"index.py" (run with "python index.py"). That should automatically open the application in your browser.
For more information from this point forward you can read our manual for navigating you through our dashboard.
